# Ayah Today

This is a frontend web development project that I created for the
[freecodecamp quote generator](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine) project. I decided to give it my own Islamic spin. It generates random verses from the Quran and displays them with the option to tweet it.

You can find it running at [ayah.today](http://ayah.today)

## Usage
1. Clone this repo
```
git clone git@github.com:rkalis/ayah.today.git
```
2. Run locally with browser reload during development
```
npm run dev
```
3. Or just build it for production
```
npm run build
```
The minimised and production-ready files will be in www/
