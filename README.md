# Ayah Today

This is a frontend web development project that I created for the
[freecodecamp quote generator](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine) project. I decided to give it my own Islamic spin. It generates random verses from the Quran and displays them with the option to tweet it.

You can find it running at [ayah.today](http://ayah.today)
